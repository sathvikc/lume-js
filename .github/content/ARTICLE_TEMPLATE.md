## 🚨 CRITICAL: Writing Guidelines

**This content MUST sound human-written, not AI-generated.**

### ❌ FORBIDDEN (Never Use These)

**Robotic Openers:**
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "As we navigate the digital age..."
- "In recent years..."
- "It's no secret that..."

**Corporate Buzzwords:**
- "leveraging synergies"
- "cutting-edge"
- "robust"
- "seamless experience"
- "paradigm shift"
- "game-changer"
- "next-level"
- "revolutionary"
- "innovative solution"
- "empower"
- "transformative"

**Filler Words/Phrases:**
- "furthermore"
- "moreover"
- "additionally"
- "it should be noted that"
- "it is important to mention"
- "needless to say"
- "at the end of the day"

**AI Tells:**
- Excessive dashes (-)
- Overuse of quotation marks ("word")
- Lists with perfect grammar
- Overly formal transitions
- Same sentence structure repeated

### ✅ DO Use (Sound Human)

**Natural Transitions:**
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's break it down"
- "What this really means is..."
- "You know what's interesting?"
- "Look at it this way"
- "Real talk"
- "Quick example"

**Conversational Style:**
- Start sentences conversationally
- Vary sentence length (short. Medium length. Sometimes longer to make a point.)
- Use contractions (it's, we're, you'll, don't)
- Ask rhetorical questions
- Use "you" and "we"
- Be opinionated (when appropriate)
- Show personality

**Good Examples:**
```
❌ "In the modern JavaScript ecosystem, developers are constantly seeking performant solutions."

✅ "JavaScript developers have a problem. Most frameworks are bloated. We built lume-js different."

---

❌ "This cutting-edge library leverages a robust reactivity system to provide a seamless experience."

✅ "Lume-js is tiny (1.4KB) but it handles reactivity better than libraries 10x its size. Here's how."

---

❌ "Furthermore, it should be noted that the bundle size is remarkably small."

✅ "Bundle size? 1.4KB gzipped. That's smaller than most logos."
```
